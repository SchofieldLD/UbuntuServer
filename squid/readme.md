The squid transparent proxy works for our client thing that recieves DHCP which would useually be something like 10.0.0.1 it will block and example website called neverssl, more blocks could be added into the /etc/squid/denied-sites.squid if one so desires.
Aditionally the firewall is configured to allow squid and the ports it's operating on so it is recommended you do not touch the default firewall that squid is using unless you want to allow it through UFW. Youtube was also included in the denied sites for testing purposes but I belive it will not work as I have it moved down.
