The DHCP server is very simple operating with addresses of 10.0.0.1 to around 10.0.0.100 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 generally it works completely fine and when a client machine is hooked up I was instantly recieving these addresses even after I added a few network cards for testing purposes, the client machine will be going through the ubuntu server to get to the internet so it should have full connectivity to the internet. Evidently if you are not happy with these IP's feel free to change them in the /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf furthermore the subnet mask and such can be adjusted and the range if you need more people connecting to the server.
